This is an initial release of an Automatic Speech Recognition system built by Cantab Research for APM. 

It uses the Julius decoder, and is executed with the script cantabAPM.sh as follows: 
./cantabAPM.sh <wavFile> <outputFile>
where <wavFile> is the audio file to be recognised and <outputFile> is the output JSON file of the recognised text.
